    <h2>Understanding Branching in Git</h2>
    <p>Branching in Git allows you to diverge from the main line of development and continue to work independently without affecting the main line. This is particularly useful for working on new features or fixing bugs.</p>
    
    <h2>Creating a Branch in VS Code</h2>
    <p>To create a branch in VS Code:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Command Palette by pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+P</kbd> (Windows/Linux) or <kbd>Cmd+Shift+P</kbd> (Mac).</li>
        <li>Type 'Git: Create Branch...' and select it. Enter the name for your new branch and press Enter.</li>
        <li>Your branch will be created and automatically checked out.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Switching Between Branches</h2>
    <p>To switch between branches:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Open the Source Control panel.</li>
        <li>Click on the branch name at the bottom left of the VS Code window.</li>
        <li>Select the branch you want to switch to from the list that appears.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Why Use Branching?</h2>
    <p>Branching is a core concept in Git that allows multiple developers to work on different features simultaneously without interfering with each other's work. It enables a more organized and flexible way to manage changes and ensures the main branch remains stable.</p>
    
    <p>Understanding how to efficiently use branches will significantly enhance your workflow in version control and collaborative projects.</p>
