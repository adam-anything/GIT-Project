    <h2>Performing Basic Git Operations in Visual Studio Code</h2>
    <p>Visual Studio Code integrates seamlessly with Git, allowing you to perform essential operations directly within the editor. Here's a guide to some basic Git operations you can do within VS Code.</p>
    
    <h3>Checking the Status</h3>
    <p>Open the Source Control panel by clicking on the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar on the side of the window or pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Shift+G</kbd>. This view shows the current state of your repository, including changed files, staged changes, and any incoming or outgoing commits.</p>
    
    <h3>Adding Files to Staging</h3>
    <p>To add changes to your next commit, you can stage them by clicking the '+' icon next to each file listed in the Source Control view. Alternatively, you can stage all changes by clicking the '+' icon at the top of the changes list.</p>
    
    <h3>Committing Changes</h3>
    <p>Once you've staged your changes, commit them by typing a commit message in the message box at the top of the Source Control sidebar and pressing <kbd>Ctrl+Enter</kbd> (or clicking the checkmark icon). Make sure your commit message is meaningful and describes the changes you've made.</p>
    
    <h3>Pushing and Pulling</h3>
    <p>To share your commits with others or to keep your local repository up to date with the remote repository, use the push and pull commands. Push your changes by clicking on the '...' menu in the Source Control view and selecting 'Push'. Similarly, you can pull changes by selecting 'Pull' from the same menu.</p>
    
    <p>These operations are foundational for working with Git in VS Code, enabling you to manage your code changes effectively and collaborate with others on projects.</p>
