    <h2>Creating Pull Requests</h2>
    <p>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into the base branch.</p>
    <p>To create a pull request:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Push your branch and changes to your remote repository on GitHub.</li>
        <li>Go to your repository on GitHub and click on 'Pull requests' then click 'New pull request'.</li>
        <li>Select the branch that has your changes and the branch you want to merge the changes into.</li>
        <li>Review the changes, add a description explaining your changes, and click 'Create pull request'.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Reviewing Pull Requests in VS Code</h2>
    <p>VS Code has extensions such as GitHub Pull Requests and Issues that allow you to review pull requests directly within the editor. Hereâ€™s how you can use it:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Install the GitHub Pull Requests and Issues extension from the VS Code Marketplace.</li>
        <li>Once installed, authenticate with GitHub through the extension.</li>
        <li>You can then view, check out, and review pull requests by navigating to the GitHub Pull Requests view in the Source Control sidebar.</li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>Reviewing pull requests directly in VS Code allows you to check out branches, review changes, and even comment on lines of code in a more integrated environment.</p>
